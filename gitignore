<h2>Gitignore work</h2>

To untrack every file that is now in your .gitignore:

First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:
<pre>git rm -r --cached .</pre>

This removes any changed files from the index(staging area), then just run:
<pre>git add .</pre>

Commit it:
<pre>git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"</pre>
